### ENCODER 8TO3 DATAFLOW Modelling

**AIM:**

To implement  Encoder 8 To 3 in Dataflow Modelling using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:** Quartus prime

**THEORY**

**Encoder 8 To 3**

The 8 to 3 line Encoder is also known as Octal to Binary Encoder. In 8 to 3 line encoder, there is a total of eight inputs, i.e., D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, and D7 and three outputs, i.e., A0, A1, and A2. In 8-input lines, one input-line is set to true at a time to get the respective binary code in the output side. Below are the block diagram and the truth table of the 8 to 3 line encoder.

The logical expression of the term A0, A1, and A2 are as follows:

A0 = D1 + D3 + D5 + D7

A1 = D2 + D3 + D6 + D7

A2 = D4 + D5 + D6 + D7

Logical circuit of the above expressions is given below:

**Procedure**

Step1: Define the specifications and initialize the design.

Step2: Declare the name of the entity and architecture by using VHDL source code.

Step3: Write the source code in VERILOG.

Step4: Check the syntax and debug the errors if found, obtain the synthesis report.

Step5: Verify the output by simulating the source code.

Step6: Write all possible combinations of input using the test bench.

Step7: Obtain the place and route report.

**PROGRAM**

 Program for Encoder 8 To 3 in Dataflow Modelling and verify its truth table in quartus using Verilog programming.
